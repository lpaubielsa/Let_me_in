####"Let me in!" is the result of the 6-week physical computing workshop by Fabian Morón Zirfas at the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam.

This DIY-project solves a daily problem at a reasonable price.

**The Problem:**

I have a cat that often goes outside in the garden and when it comes back, the window is often closed. Sometimes this happens when I'm in another room or listening to loud music, so I can't hear it meowing.

**The Solution:**

A device that notifies me when my cat is waiting outside the window.
